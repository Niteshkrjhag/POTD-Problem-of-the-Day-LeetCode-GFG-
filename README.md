Welcome to **POTD (Problem of the Day)** 🚀  
This repository is my **daily problem-solving journal**, where I consistently solve **Problem of the Day (POTD)** challenges from **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks** to strengthen my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **logical thinking skills**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The primary goals of this repository are:

- 🧠 Improve **algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills**
- 📈 Build **consistency** through daily practice
- 🧩 Learn how to **break down problems systematically**
- 💻 Write **clean, readable, and optimized code**
- 🎤 Prepare **interview-ready explanations**
- 📚 Create a **revision-friendly reference** for future use

This repository focuses on **clarity, correctness, and reasoning**, not just passing test cases.

## 🧩 What Each Solution Contains

Every problem solution in this repository follows a **structured and disciplined format**:

### 1️⃣ Thought Process
- Clear explanation of how the problem is analyzed
- Key observations and edge cases
- Reasoning behind choosing a particular approach

### 2️⃣ High-Level Pseudocode
- Language-agnostic representation of the logic
- Helps understand the algorithm without syntax distractions
- Useful for interviews and exams

### 3️⃣ Actual Implementation
- Clean and readable code
- Optimized for time and space complexity
- Written with beginner-friendly clarity but interview-level correctness
